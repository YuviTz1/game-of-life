        <p>Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:</p>
        <p>1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</p>
        <p>2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</p>
        <p>3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</p>
        <p>4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</p>
